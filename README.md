## My process

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS Vanilla

### What I learned

This was my first Javascript project, and i learn so much about events, node list to array and DOM manipulation. Took me a while to discover how to toogle the question, and i try so many methods, and the more simple work it, so i'm pretty happy with it. The way i acomplished to do it was by a direct event in the html file, kinda arcaic but it works.
```
    <div onclick='function(indexof)'>

Example:
    <div onclick='toggle(0)'>

```

### Continued development

I imagine that are very easier ways to do this task, so i want to learn more about DOM manipulation, and better practices to it, advices and tips are welcome.
